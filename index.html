Have fun exploring the content.</p><h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/dsd-dbs/capella-collab-manager/>Capella Collaboration Manager</a></h2>A web platform for collaboration on MBSE and Capella projects.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/openrail/dac-migration-dss/>DAC Migration DSS</a></h2>Within the next years around 500 K freight wagons all over Europe owned and operated by various corporations will be converted from screw couplers to digital automatic couplers (DAC). To facilitate the migration process, a decision support system (DSS) is planned under the project.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/sbb/das/>Driver Advisory System</a></h2>Driver Advisory System is an innovative tool designed to assist train drivers in the delivery of efficient and punctual train services. By integrating a wide range of data sources, including live positioning, infrastructure characteristics, and real-time transport plans, the system calculates and presents the ideal driving profile for each journey.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/openrail/liblrs/>libLRS</a></h2>The goal of the library is to have a flexible, high performance and easy to integrate linear referencing systems (LRS) library that can be used in any system to manipulate LRSs.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/matsim-org/matsim-libs/>MATSim</a></h2>MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) is an open-source framework and set of Java libraries for large-scale agent-based transport simulations, supporting demand modelling, mobility simulation, iterative re-planning, and analysis.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/uic/merits-open-source-tools/>MERITS Transformation Tools</a></h2>Transformation of both timetable and location data structures between MERITS EDIFACT and CSV in both directions.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/motis-project/motis/>MOTIS</a></h2>multimodal routing, geocoding, and map tiles<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/openrail/nge/>Netzgrafik-Editor</a></h2>Netzgrafik-Editor is now a mature tool for creating and analyzing regular-interval timetables. It&rsquo;s versatile for logistics planning in various domains. Features include interactive editing, graphic timetables, trainrun editing, and logistics analysis.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/entur/netex-parser-java/>nextex-parser-java</a></h2>Parse NeTEx files and lookup entities in an index<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/opentripplanner/opentripplanner/>OpenTripPlanner</a></h2>An open source multi-modal trip planner
https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/uic/osdm-demo-app/>OSDM Demo App</a></h2>To showcase the power of OSDM the Demo App aims to provide a working app to interesting parties to start implementing their apps and clients. The app covers the complete booking flow, including ancillary services, and supports trains, buses or other means of public transport. The code found here is the second implementation based on the results of the Drei-Länder-Hack 2024. Further development includes the implementation of seat reservations and after-sales<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/openrail/osrd/>OSRD</a></h2>OSRD is an open source web application for railway infrastructure design, capacity analysis, timetabling and simulation.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/dsd-dbs/raillabel/>RailLabel</a></h2>A devkit for working with recorded and annotated train ride data from Deutsche Bahn.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/openrail/rcm-oss/>RCM OSS</a></h2>RCM by SBB comprises a suite of products for rail condition monitoring. Based on the open-source data format RCM-DX (RCM Data eXchange), RCM enables easy accessibility and visualization of railway diagnostic data.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/sbb/sbb-ml-models/>SBB ML Models</a></h2>Trained YOLOv5 object‑detection models and tooling for running models on mobile (CoreML for iOS, TensorFlow Lite for Android), targeting objects in trains and stations.<h2><a href=/landscape/projects/projects/sbb/sbb-rasta-stack/>SBB RASTA Stack</a></h2>The RASTA Stack is a reference architecture and set of components for railway traffic management and operations systems. It enables the integration of heterogeneous systems, supports real-time data exchange, and provides a foundation for building scalable, interoperable railway applications.</main><footer><p>Mapped with ❤️ by the OpenRail Community.</p></footer></body></html>

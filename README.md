# Open Rail and Transport Landscape

This repository collects reference to open source projects in the context of rail and transport. It focuses on software for the railway sector, but also includes open transport and adjacent topics. It's meant to be inclusive, so if in doubt it probably is in scope.

## Project metadata

We collect metadata for projects in a structured format in this repository or as links to metadata in other places. The format we use is based on [publiccode.yml](https://yml.publiccode.tools/).

## Landscape display

The landscape display is realized as a Hugo-generated static web site. This repo contains the necessary code, templates, and resources.
